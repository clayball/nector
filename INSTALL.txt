NECTOR Installation
===================

NECTOR requires the following be installed:

- NECTOR (see https://github.com/clayball/nector )
- Python 2 (see https://www.python.org )
- Pip (comes with Python 2.7.9+)
- Django ( pip install Django==1.10 )
	Note: You may use any version of Django past 1.10. NECTOR was developed
	 with Django 1.10, but newer versions should work. 1.10 guarantees
	 usability, however.
- [OPTIONAL] nmap (see https://nmap.org/download.html )
	Note: nmap is only necessary for gathering hosts/subnets for the
	 Hosts/Subnets feature.
       (See 'Import Hosts/Subnets/Vulnerabilities' below.)

Run Demo (OPTIONAL)
=====================

NOTE: This step is optional. Performing this step may interfere with the
semantics of future steps, but will not render them unusable.

If you want to see what NECTOR is like before committing to the rest of the
install instructions, run:

	$ make demo

This will perform model migrations, copy the sample files, and run the server
automatically. All you'll have to do after this is open a browser and go to

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/


Add Key to settings.py
======================

Traverse into the nector/ subdirectory and open settings.py in a text editor.

Find the line

	SECRET_KEY = 'THISISTOPSECR3t,MAN!'

and replace it with your own Django secret key.

You can generate one at

    http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/


Import Hosts/Subnets/Vulnerabilities
====================================

Once the above is installed, IF YOU INTEND ON USING THE SUBNETS/HOSTS, VULNZ,
EVENTS, & CENSYS FEATURES (recommended), modify the following files to fit your
needs:

- sample-hosts.xml
	- Collection of hosts gathered through nmap host discovery list scan.
- sample-subnets.txt
	- Collection of subnets.
- sample-vulnlist.csv
	- Collection of vulnerabilities related to hosts.
- sample-events.csv
	- Collection of events.
- sample-censys-keys.csv
	- Censys API Key & Secret Key.
	- Note: Keys can be obtained by making an account here: https://censys.io/

Next, rename the five files to:

- hosts.xml
- subnets.txt
- vulnlist.csv
- events.csv
- censys.csv


Running NECTOR
==============

To utilize NECTOR, run the provided makefile:

$ make

This performs necessary migrations and imports, then runs a NECTOR server.
Finally, open your favorite internet browser and enter the address:

127.0.0.1:8000

Enjoy! :)
